## FAQ

**Q1. Several TODOs say "appropriately". What does that mean? Can you please clarify?**

A1. That's a stupid question because in each case YOU have to make an appropriate decision. That's what you get paid to do. If you can't, the company has no interest in hiring you because you're high maintenance. You applied for a full stack position. If you don't know at least one way to solve a TODO in the vanilla practicum, you shouldn't get the position because you aren't qualified.

**Q2. This isn't industy. We're in school. What does "appropriately" mean in each case? You should teach what's necessary, and then clearly communicate what's expected.**

A2. _We're in school, not industry?_ Duh. Thank you, Captain Obvious.

You're a senior, soon to graduate. It's entirely appropriate to practice what is expected in the workplace.

However, since you're accusing me of derelection of duty, I kindly remind you that you did an _appropriate_ lab or two in _CS 2550 Web I_ demonstrating you knew at least one appropriate way for every TODO. You are expected to retain the skills and knowledge from previous classes. If you can't remember, it's on you to do the research.

**Q3. You misspelled _student_. Should I correct it?**

A3. Oh yeah? You mispelled _mispelled_.

Like Q1 and Q2, you can answer your own question by asking yourself the golden question,

#### _What would an employer expect?_

**Q4. When I forked the backend, it changed the URL. That broke my REST end points. What should I do? Can you change the URL in the TODO?**

A4. Fix it, darn it! Why do you think you were asked to record your unique URL?

**Q5. Why did you call Q1 a stupid question? I was told, "_There's no stupid question._"**

A5. You were lied to. I told you the truth. You're welcome.
