# Getting Started

0. Hover on the icons above right to see the tooltips. Click the icon that says _Open Preview to the side_ to see this markdown rendered as it was intended to be viewed. Close this file (**readme.md**). The preview will remain open.

1. Click _Fork_ icon above left.

2. Click _Share_ icon above left. Record your unique URL.

3. Reload this browser tab with your unique URL. You'll have to repeat step #0.

# Backend

4. In Terminal panel below, run `npm run server` to start the app server. You will see `index.html` in `public` rendered in a panel to the right.

## Backend Notes

- You will use this backend for many future practicums.

- **json-server** is a spoofed server, not a robust backend. It's an easy and awesome prototyping tool to see if your client works without you first having to write your server.

- You will write a robust server in a future Practicum that replaces **json-server**.

# Frontend

5. Complete the _TODOs_ in **index.html**, **style.css**, and **script.js**.

6. Make sure you comply with the **Negative Requirements** below.

7. Reset **db.json** back to its original contents (**db.bak.json**).

8. Submit your Practicum Vanilla URL.

9. Do your two peer reviews. Canvas will auto-assign them at the deadline.

10. Rejoice like a Provo squirrel finding a Brazil nut.
